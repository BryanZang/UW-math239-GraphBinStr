# GraphOfBinStr
Motivated by a tutorial question from UWaterloo's MATH239 course (intro to combinatorics)

Let G be a graph defined as follows:
  V(G) is the set of binary strings with length n that have at most one block of 1's and
  two vertices are adjacent if and only if they differ in exactly one position

We wish to determine |V(G)| and |E(G)| for n is an integer greater than or equal to 0.
